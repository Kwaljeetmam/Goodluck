<p>Plants are mainly multicellular organisms, predominantly photosynthetic eukaryotes
 of the kingdom Plantae. Historically, plants were treated as one of two kingdoms including
 all living things that were not animals, and all algae and fungi were treated as
 plants. However, all current definitions of Plantae exclude the fungi and some 
algae, as well as the prokaryotes (the archaea and bacteria). By one definition, 
plants form the clade Viridiplantae (Latin name for "green plants"), a group that 
includes the flowering plants, conifers and other gymnosperms, ferns and their 
allies, hornworts, liverworts, mosses, and the green algae, but excludes the red 
and brown algae.Green plants obtain most of their energy from sunlight via
photosynthesis by primary chloroplasts that are derived from endosymbiosis with
 cyanobacteria. Their chloroplasts contain chlorophylls a and b, which gives
 them their green color. Some plants are parasitic or mycotrophic and have lost
 the ability to produce normal amounts of chlorophyll or to photosynthesize, but 
still have flowers, fruits, and seeds. Plants are characterized by sexual 
reproduction and alternation of generations, although asexual reproduction 
is also common.There are about 320,000 species of plants, of which the great 
majority, some 260–290 thousand, produce seeds. Green plants provide a 
substantial proportion of the world's molecular oxygen,and are the basis of most 
of Earth's ecosystems. Plants that produce grain, fruit, and vegetables also form
 basic human foods and have been domesticated for millennia. Plants have many
 cultural and other uses, as ornaments, building materials, writing material and, 
in great variety, they have been the source of medicines and psychoactive drugs
. The scientific study of plants is known as botany, a branch of biology</p>
<br><br>
<h2>Defination</h2>
<p>All living things were traditionally placed into one of two groups, plants and animals. This classification may date from Aristotle (384 BC – 322 BC), who made the distinction between plants, which generally do not move, and animals, which often are mobile to catch their food. Much later, when Linnaeus (1707–1778) created the basis of the modern system of scientific classification, these two groups became the kingdoms Vegetabilia (later Metaphyta or Plantae) and Animalia (also called Metazoa). Since then, it has become clear that the plant kingdom as originally defined included several unrelated groups, and the fungi and several groups of algae were removed to new kingdoms. However, these organisms are still often considered plants, particularly in popular contexts.
The term "plant" generally implies the possession of the following traits: multicellularity, possession of cell walls containing cellulose, and the ability to carry out photosynthesis with primary chloroplasts</p>

<h3><font size="1000" color="green"><center><u>Parts  of Plant</u></center></font> </h3> 
<img src="https://media-mycbseguide.s3.amazonaws.com/images/static/revise/11/biology/11_Bio_ch05_01.png" width="1000" height="1000">
<br>
<font size="500">Root</font>
<p>Roots are the most important and underground part of a plant, which are collectively called the root system. They are the major part that anchors the plant firmly in the soil. They absorb water and minerals from the soil, synthesise plant growth regulators, and store reserve food material. The apical part of the root is covered by the root cap that protects the root apex<br>.
The direct elongation of radicle leads to the formation of primary roots that grow inside the soil in dicots. It bears lateral roots that are known as secondary and tertiary roots.<br>
In monocots, the primary root is replaced by a large number of roots because it is short-lived. In some plants such as Banyan tree, the roots arise from the parts of the plant and not from the radical. <br>
Such roots are known as adventitious roots.
A few plants that grow in swampy areas have roots growing vertically upwards to get oxygen for respiration. Such roots are known as pneumatophores.</p>
<br><br>
<font size="500">Stem</font>
<p>The stem is the part of the plant which is found above the ground. The bark of trees are brown in colour and younger stems are green in colour. It forms the basis of the shoot system and bears leaves, fruits and flowers. The region where the leaves arise is known as the node and the region between the nodes is known as the internode.
<br>
Stems arise from the plumule, vertically upwards to the ground. Initially, stems are usually weak and cannot stand straight. It eventually grows to become the toughest part of the plant called the trunk. The trunk is covered by a thick outer covering known as the bark. Overall stem provides a definite framework and structure to a plant, which later develops into a tree.
<br>
The stem provides support to the plant. They also protect the plant and help in vegetative propagation. A few underground stems such as potato and ginger are modified to store food.
<br><br>
The important functions of a stem include:<br>
1)A stem carries out a number of functions essential for various processes such 
as photosynthesis.<br>
2)Provides a definite framework and structure to a plant which later develops into a tree.<br>
3)Support: Primary function of the stem is to hold up buds, flowers, leaves, and fruits to the plant.<br>
4)Along with the roots, a stem anchors the plants and helps them to stand upright and perpendicular to the ground.<br>
<br>
5)Transportation: It is the part which transports water and minerals from the root and prepared food from leaves to other parts of the plant.<br>
6)Storage: Stems are one of the storerooms of plants where the prepared food is stored in the form of starch. The stems of a few plants in the desert areas, such as Opuntia, get modified into thick, fleshy structures that store food and prevent excessive water loss due to transpiration.<br>
7)Reproduction: A few stems help in reproduction through vegetative propagation and also help to bear flowers and to produce fruits.<br>
8)Guards: Protects Xylem and phloem allowing them to perform their functions. The stem tendrils are spirally coiled and help the plant to climb support. The axillary buds also get modified into thorns that protect the plant from grazing animals.<br>
9)The stems of a few plants in the desert areas, such as Opuntia, get modified into thick, fleshy structures that store food and prevent excessive water loss due to transpiration.</p><br>
<br><br><br><br>
<font size="500">Leaves</font>
<p>Leaves are the most important part of a plant. They contain chlorophyll that helps the plants to prepare their food using sunlight, carbon dioxide and water. A leaf consists of three main parts- petiole, leaf base and lamina.
<br><br>
1)The petiole keeps the leaf blade exposed to wind and cools the leaf.<br>
2)The leaf base is a protruding part of a leaf.<br>
3)The lamina of the leaf contains veins and veinlets that provide rigidity to the leaf blade and help in the transport of mineral nutrients.<br>
4)Primarily, leaves have three main functions:<br>
<br><br>
5)Photosynthesis: Green leaves prepare food for plants by using water and carbon dioxide in the presence of sunlight. This process is called photosynthesis<br>.
6)Transpiration: Other than photosynthesis, leaves play a crucial role in the removal of excess of water from plants through tiny pores called stomata. This is the process of transpiration.<br>
7)Reproduction: Leaves of some plants helps in reproduction also. For e.g. leaves of Bryophyllum give rise to a new Bryophyllum plant.</p><br>

<br><br><br><br>
<font size="500" >Fruit</font><br><br><br><br>
<p>Fruits are the main features of a flowering plant. It is a matured ovary that develops after fertilisation. Some fruits are developed without fertilization and are known as parthenocarpic fruits and the process is known as Parthenocarpy.</p>
<br><br><br><br>
<font size="500">Flower</font>
<img src="https://d1whtlypfis84e.cloudfront.net/guides/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/30070142/parts-of-a-flower-300x200.jpg" width="1340" height="1000">
<br><br><br>
<font size="500"><u>Parts of Flower</u></font>
<p><font size="500">Vegetative Parts of a Flower</font><br>
The vegetative part of a flower consists of the following:<br>
<br><br>
1)Petals: This is a bright-coloured part that attracts bees, insects, and birds. Colour of petals varies from plant to plant; some are bright while some are pale coloured. Thus, petals help us to differentiate one flower from another.<br>
2)Sepals: Sepal is the green-coloured part beneath the petals to protect rising buds. Some flowers have fused petals-sepals while a few have separated petals-sepals.<br></p>
<br><br>
<p><font size="500">Reproductive Parts of a Flower</font><br>
Flowers contain the plant’s reproductive structures<br>
<br><br>
In different plants, the number of petals, sepals, stamens and pistils can vary. The presence of these parts differentiates the flower into complete or incomplete. Apart from these parts, a flower includes reproductive parts – stamen and pistil.  A flower may have only female parts, only male parts, or both.<br>
 <br><br>
The reproductive parts of a flower consist of the following:<br>
<br><br>
1)Stamen: This is the male reproductive organ and is also known as Androecium. It consists of two parts namely: anther and filaments.<br>
2The anther is a yellowish, sac-like structure, involved in producing and storing the pollens.<br>
3)The filament is a slender, threadlike object, which functions by supporting the anther.<br>
4)Pistil: This is the innermost part and the female reproductive organ of a flower which comprises three parts -stigma, style and ovary. This is collectively known as the pistil.<br>
5)Stigma: It is the topmost part or receptive tip of carpels in the gynoecium of a flower.<br>
6)Style: It is the long tube-like slender stalk that connects stigma and the ovary.<br>
7)Ovary: It is the ductless reproductive gland that holds a lot of ovules. It is the part of the plant where the seed formation takes place.<br></p>
<br><br>
<p><font size="500">Whorls</font><br>
Along with the vegetative and reproductive parts, a flower is also composed of four whorls, which are largely responsible for the radial arrangement of a flower. A typical flower has a circular section with a common centre, which can be clearly observed and distinguished from the top of the flower. There are four whorls:
<br>
</p>
<p><font size="500">Calyx</font><br>
<br>
The calyx is the outermost whorl of a flower. It comprises sepals, tiny leaves present at the base of a flower. These protect the flower whorls against mechanical injuries and desiccation. Some plants have coloured sepals the calyx and are called petaloid.<br>
<br>
If the sepals are free the calyx is called polysepalous, and if they are united it is called gamosepalous.<br>
<br>
In many flowers, the sepals fall off before the flower even opens fully. Such sepals are known as caducous.<br>
<br>
In some, the sepals fall off after fertilization. Such sepals are known as deciduous.<br>
<br>
The persistent sepals remain up to the fruiting stage</p><br>
<br><br>
<font size="500" >Corolla</font>
<p>Corolla
<br>
This is the second whorl of a flower. It contains petals which serve two main functions:<br>
<br>
1)To attract pollinators.<br>
2)To protect the reproductive parts of a flower<br>
3)Petals are brightly coloured and scented to attract animals and insects for pollination. The calyx and corolla are collectively called the perianth.<br>
<br>
Different forms of the corolla are found in the flowers.<br>
<br>
1)Polypetalous Regular<br>
2)Polypetalous Irregular<br>
3)Gamopetalous Regular<br>
4)Gamopetalous Irregular</p><br>
<br><br>
<font size="500">Stamen</font>
<br>
Stamen is also known as the third whorl of the flower and is the male reproductive part. It consists of a filament which is a thread-like structure with a circular structure anther on the top. Pollen is produced by the anther which contributes to the male reproductive process of the plant. All the stamens do not bear fertile anthers.
<br><br>
<font size="500">Carpel</font><br>
The carpel is the fourth whorl of the flower present in the centre. The carpels contain the pistil, the female reproductive part of the flower. It comprises the ovary, style, and stigma. The egg or the ovule is present in the ovary. After fertilization, sometimes the ovary turns into the fruit to keep the seed. At the top of the ovary is a vertical structure called style that supports the stigma. The dispersed pollens stick to the stigma and travel down to the ovary through the style.
This was an overview of the different parts of a flower.
<br><br><br>
<font size="500">Fuctions of Flower </font>
<br>
1)Gametophytes develop in the flowers.<br>
2)The flowers can produce diaspores without fertilization.<br>
3)After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into a fruit containing a seed.<br>
4)The most important function of flowers is reproduction. They help in the union of male and female gametes.<br>
5)Flowers provide nectar to certain birds and insects, which in turn help in the transfer of pollen from one flower to the other.<br>
6)Flowers may promote selfing, i.e., the union of sperms and eggs from the same flower, or cross-fertilization, i.e., the union of sperms and eggs from different flowers.<br>
<br><br><br>
<font size="500">Pollination</font>
<p>Pollination is the process in which the pollens are transferred from anther to stigma. The process of pollination can occur through a different medium.
<br>
The table mentioned below describes the different types of pollination along with their pollinating agents.
<br>

<br><br><br>
<font size="500"><center>Some Dangours Plants</center></font>
<big>Water Hemlock (Cicuta maculata)<br><br>
<p>Closely related to poison hemlock (the plant that famously killed Socrates), water hemlock has been deemed "the most violently toxic plant in North America." A large wildflower in the carrot family, water hemlock resembles Queen Anne’s lace and is sometimes confused with edible parsnips or celery. However, water hemlock is infused with deadly cicutoxin, especially in its roots, and will rapidly generate potentially fatal symptoms in anyone unlucky enough to eat it. Painful convulsions, abdominal cramps, nausea, and death are common, and those who survive are often afflicted with amnesia or lasting tremors.</p>

<br><br><br>
<center>Deadly Nightshade (Atropa belladonna)</center>
<p>According to legend, Macbeth’s soldiers poisoned the invading Danes with wine made from the sweet fruit of deadly nightshade. Indeed, it is the sweetness of the berries that often lures children and unwitting adults to consume this lethal plant. A native of wooded or waste areas in central and southern Eurasia, deadly nightshade has dull green leaves and shiny black berries about the size of cherries. Nightshade contains atropine and scopolamine in its stems, leaves, berries, and roots, and causes paralysis in the involuntary muscles of the body, including the heart. Even physical contact with the leaves may cause skin irritation.</p>

<br><br><br>
<center>White Snakeroot (Ageratina altissima)
</center>
<p>An innocuous plant, white snakeroot was responsible for the death of Abraham Lincoln’s mother, Nancy Hanks. White snakeroot is a North American herb with flat-topped clusters of small white flowers and contains a toxic alcohol known as trematol. Unlike those who have died from directly ingesting deadly plants, poor Nancy Hanks was poisoned by simply drinking the milk of a cow who had grazed on the plant. Indeed, both the meat and milk from poisoned livestock can pass the toxin to human consumers. Symptoms of "milk poisoning" include loss of appetite, nausea, weakness, abdominal discomfort, reddened tongue, abnormal acidity of the blood, and death. Luckily farmers are now aware of this life-threatening hazard and make efforts remove the plant from animal pastures.</p>

<br><br><br>
<center>Castor Bean (Ricinus communis)</center>
<p>Widely grown as an ornamental, the castor bean is an attractive plant native to Africa. While the processed seeds are the source of castor oil, they naturally contain the poison ricin and are deadly in small amounts. It only takes one or two seeds to kill a child and up to eight to kill an adult. Ricin works by inhibiting the synthesis of proteins within cells and can cause severe vomiting, diarrhea, seizures, and even death. The poison was used in 1978 to assassinate Georgi Markov, a journalist who spoke out against the Bulgarian government, and has been mailed to several U.S. politicians in failed terrorism attempts. Most fatalities are the result of accidental ingestion by children and pets.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/q:60/59/43759-004-8526C616/Castor-bean-details-seeds-fruit.jpg">
<br><br><br>
<center>Rosary Pea (Abrus precatorius)</center>
<p>Also called jequirity beans, these piously-named seeds contain abrin, an extremely deadly ribosome-inhibiting protein. Rosary peas are native to tropical areas and are often used in jewelry and prayer rosaries. While the seeds are not poisonous if intact, seeds that are scratched, broken, or chewed can be lethal. It only takes 3 micrograms of abrin to kill an adult, less than the amount of poison in one seed, and it is said that numerous jewelry makers have been made ill or died after accidentally pricking their fingers while working with the seeds. Like ricin, abrin prevents protein synthesis within cells and can cause organ failure within four days.</p>

<br><br><br>
<center>Oleander (Nerium oleander)</center>
<p>Described by Pliny the Elder in Ancient Rome, oleander is a beautiful plant known for its striking flowers. Though commonly grown as a hedge and ornamental, all parts of the oleander plant are deadly and contain lethal cardiac glycosides known as oleandrin and neriine. If eaten, oleander can cause vomiting, diarrhea, erratic pulse, seizures, coma, and death, and contact with the leaves and sap is known to be a skin irritant to some people. Indeed, the toxins in oleander are so strong that people have become ill after eating honey made by bees that visited the flowers! Fortunately, fatalities from oleander poisoning are rare, as the plant is very bitter and thus quickly deters anyone sampling the vegetation.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/q:60/59/118159-050-1A900BE0/oleander-rosebay.jpg">
<br><br><br>
<center>Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum)</center>
<p>Tobacco  is the most widely grown commercial non-food plant in the world. All parts of the plant, especially its leaves, contain the toxic alkaloids nicotine and anabasine, and can be fatal if eaten. Despite its designation as a cardiac poison, nicotine from tobacco is widely consumed around the world and is both psychoactive and addictive. Tobacco use causes more than 5 million deaths per year, making it perhaps the most deadly plant in the world.</p>
